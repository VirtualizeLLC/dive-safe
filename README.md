## Scope of the app

Dive-Safe is intended to be a companion application for technical diving operations. Its focus is to provide:

- Guided procedures for complex rebreather setups and maintenance.
- Checklists and step-by-step assembly/disassembly guides.
- Safety reminders and community-shared configuration notes.
- Offline-friendly reference materials for dive teams.

This project is strictly a development-stage tool and is not certified for operational use. See the Safety & legal disclaimer below.


## Current features

- Rebreather assembly guides (example: Choptima CCR assembly walkthrough).
- UI scaffolding with Expo and Storybook for component-driven development.
- A collapsible in-app header to switch between the full app and Storybook/demo view.
- Basic navigation and a modular component structure.


## Upcoming features

Planned additions include:

- Per-rebreather endorsed configuration pages with step-by-step checklists.
- Community comment and endorsement system (moderated contributions).
- Offline caching and encrypted storage of critical configs (MMKV integration).
- Export/import of validated assembly checklists.
- Enhanced device integration (bluetooth logging, transmit to dive computers).


## Platform support

- iOS: supported (development builds and simulator)
- Android: supported (development builds and emulator)
- Desktop / Web: experimental (web support via Expo web; desktop native builds TBD)


## Types of support & community contributions

We plan to support several structured contribution types so divers and technical editors can add value while keeping safety in mind.

### In-depth rebreather setup guides

- Each supported rebreather model will have a dedicated guide containing:
  - Assembly and disassembly steps with images.
  - Recommended settings and configurables.
  - Common maintenance checkpoints.
  - Known caveats and community-provided tips.

- Guides will be versioned and have a strict review/endorsement workflow before being labeled as "endorsed".

### Endorsements and community comments

- Community members will be able to comment on guides and submit suggestions.
- Endorsements will be available for qualified contributors; endorsement criteria and the reviewer workflow will be defined before endorsements are published.
