## Platform support

- iOS üçé: supported (development builds and simulator)
- Android ü§ñ: supported (development builds and emulator)
- Desktop / Web üñ•Ô∏è: experimental (web support via Expo web; desktop native builds TBD)


## Types of support & community contributions

We plan to support several structured contribution types so divers and technical editors can add value while keeping safety in mind.

### In-depth rebreather setup guides

- Each supported rebreather model will have a dedicated guide containing:
  - Assembly and disassembly steps with images.
  - Recommended settings and configurables.
  - Common maintenance checkpoints.
  - Known caveats and community-provided tips.

- Guides will be versioned and have a strict review/endorsement workflow before being labeled as "endorsed".

### Endorsements and community comments

- Community members will be able to comment on guides and submit suggestions.
- Endorsements will be available for qualified contributors; endorsement criteria and the reviewer workflow will be defined before endorsements are published.
