Below is a concise feature matrix showing current, unreleased, and planned work with an ETA and short notes.\n\n| Feature | Status | ETA | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rebreather assembly guides | ‚¨ú Planned | Q4 2025 | Step-by-step walkthroughs for supported models |\n| Rebreather disassembly guides | ‚¨ú Planned | Q4 2025 | Safe teardown and cleaning steps |\n| Rebreather storage procedures | ‚¨ú Planned | Q1 2026 | Best practices for short/long-term storage |\n| Rebreather maintenance checklists | ‚¨ú Planned | Q1 2026 | Periodic and pre-dive maintenance workflows |\n| Per-rebreather endorsed configuration pages | ‚¨ú Unreleased | Q4 2025 | Requires endorsement workflow and moderation tools |\n| Community comment & endorsement system | ‚¨ú Planned | Q1 2026 | Moderation and identity verification needed |\n| Offline encrypted storage (MMKV) | ‚¨ú Planned | Q1 2026 | For sensitive configs and offline use |\n| Export/import validated checklists | ‚¨ú Planned | Q2 2026 | CSV/JSON and import validation |\n| Device integration (Bluetooth logging) | ‚¨ú Planned | 2026+ | Long-term roadmap; requires hardware partners |\n\n\nThis project is strictly a development-stage tool and is not certified for operational use. See the Safety & legal disclaimer below.\n\n## Supported Rebreathers\n\n| Rebreather Model | Assembly Guide | Disassembly Guide | Storage Procedure | Maintenance Checklist | Photos/Links |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Choptima CCR | ‚¨ú Planned | ‚¨ú Planned | ‚¨ú Planned | ‚¨ú Planned | ‚Äî |\n| <em>Your Rebreather Here</em> | ‚¨ú Contribute! | ‚¨ú Contribute! | ‚¨ú Contribute! | ‚¨ú Contribute! | (Add photos/links) |\n\n\n\n## Platform support\n\n- iOS üçé: supported (development builds and simulator)\n- Android ü§ñ: supported (development builds and emulator)\n- Desktop / Web üñ•Ô∏è: experimental (web support via Expo web; desktop native builds TBD)\n\n\n## Types of support & community contributions\n\nWe plan to support several structured contribution types so divers and technical editors can add value while keeping safety in mind.\n\n### In-depth rebreather setup guides\n\n- Each supported rebreather model will have a dedicated guide containing:\n  - Assembly and disassembly steps with images.\n  - Recommended settings and configurables.\n  - Common maintenance checkpoints.\n  - Known caveats and community-provided tips.\n\n- Guides will be versioned and have a strict review/endorsement workflow before being labeled as \"endorsed\".\n\n### Endorsements and community comments\n\n- Community members will be able to comment on guides and submit suggestions.\n- Endorsements will be available for qualified contributors; endorsement criteria and the reviewer workflow will be defined before endorsements are published.\n\n## Safety & legal disclaimer\n\nIMPORTANT: This software is experimental and under active development.
