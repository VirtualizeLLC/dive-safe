Below is a concise feature matrix showing current, unreleased, and planned work with an ETA and short notes.\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th align=\"left\">Feature</th>\n      <th align=\"center\">Status</th>\n      <th align=\"center\">ETA</th>\n      <th align=\"left\">Notes</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Rebreather assembly guides</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">‚¨ú Planned</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">Q4 2025</td>\n      <td>Step-by-step walkthroughs for supported models</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Rebreather disassembly guides</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">‚¨ú Planned</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">Q4 2025</td>\n      <td>Safe teardown and cleaning steps</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Rebreather storage procedures</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">‚¨ú Planned</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">Q1 2026</td>\n      <td>Best practices for short/long-term storage</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Rebreather maintenance checklists</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">‚¨ú Planned</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">Q1 2026</td>\n      <td>Periodic and pre-dive maintenance workflows</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Per-rebreather endorsed configuration pages</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">‚¨ú Unreleased</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">Q4 2025</td>\n      <td>Requires endorsement workflow and moderation tools</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Community comment & endorsement system</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">‚¨ú Planned</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">Q1 2026</td>\n      <td>Moderation and identity verification needed</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Offline encrypted storage (MMKV)</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">‚¨ú Planned</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">Q1 2026</td>\n      <td>For sensitive configs and offline use</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Export/import validated checklists</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">‚¨ú Planned</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">Q2 2026</td>\n      <td>CSV/JSON and import validation</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Device integration (Bluetooth logging)</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">‚¨ú Planned</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">2026+</td>\n      <td>Long-term roadmap; requires hardware partners</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nThis project is strictly a development-stage tool and is not certified for operational use.
